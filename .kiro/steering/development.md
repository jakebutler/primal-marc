# Development Best Practices

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

### Core TDD Principles
- **Red-Green-Refactor**: Write failing tests first, implement minimal code to pass, then refactor
- **Test First**: Always write tests before implementation code
- **Small Steps**: Make incremental changes with frequent test runs
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Aim for high test coverage across all layers

### Testing Strategy

#### Unit Tests
- Test individual functions, components, and classes in isolation
- Mock external dependencies and API calls
- Focus on business logic and edge cases
- Target: 90%+ coverage for critical business logic

#### Integration Tests
- Test API endpoints with real database interactions
- Test React components with user interactions
- Verify data flow between layers
- Use test databases and clean state between tests

#### End-to-End Tests
- Test complete user workflows across the application
- Verify critical user journeys (auth, content creation, AI interactions)
- Run against staging environment before production deployment
- Keep minimal but comprehensive coverage of happy paths

### Testing Tools & Patterns

#### Frontend Testing
```typescript
// Component testing with React Testing Library
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react'
import { expect, test, vi } from 'vitest'

test('should handle user interaction', async () => {
  const mockHandler = vi.fn()
  render(<Component onAction={mockHandler} />)
  
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button'))
  expect(mockHandler).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expectedData)
})
```

#### Backend Testing
```typescript
// API testing with Supertest
import request from 'supertest'
import { app } from '../src/app'

test('POST /api/content should create content', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/content')
    .send({ title: 'Test', body: 'Content' })
    .expect(201)
    
  expect(response.body).toMatchObject({
    id: expect.any(String),
    title: 'Test'
  })
})
```

## Code Quality Standards

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict TypeScript configuration
- Define explicit types for all public APIs
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` or proper typing
- Leverage union types and type guards for safety
- Use Zod for runtime validation and type inference

### Error Handling
- Use Result/Either patterns for error-prone operations
- Implement proper error boundaries in React
- Log errors with context and correlation IDs
- Return meaningful error messages to users
- Never expose internal errors to client

```typescript
// Error handling pattern
type Result<T, E = Error> = 
  | { success: true; data: T }
  | { success: false; error: E }

async function safeApiCall<T>(fn: () => Promise<T>): Promise<Result<T>> {
  try {
    const data = await fn()
    return { success: true, data }
  } catch (error) {
    return { success: false, error: error as Error }
  }
}
```

### Performance Guidelines
- Implement React.memo for expensive components
- Use React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- Lazy load routes and heavy components
- Optimize bundle size with code splitting
- Monitor Core Web Vitals and API response times

### Security Practices
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Sanitize user content before storage/display
- Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- Implement proper CORS and CSP headers
- Store sensitive data in environment variables
- Use HTTPS everywhere and secure cookie settings

## Git Workflow & Commit Practices

### Branch Strategy
- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Integration branch for features
- `feature/*`: Individual feature branches
- `hotfix/*`: Critical production fixes

### Commit Standards
- Use conventional commits format
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Include tests in the same commit as implementation

```bash
# Conventional commit format
feat(auth): add JWT refresh token rotation
fix(canvas): resolve drag-and-drop positioning bug
test(agents): add unit tests for ideation service
docs(api): update authentication endpoint documentation
```

### Code Review Process
- All code must be reviewed before merging
- Review for functionality, security, and performance
- Ensure tests are included and passing
- Verify documentation is updated
- Check for accessibility compliance

## Development Workflow

### Feature Development Process
1. **Planning**: Review requirements and design documents
2. **Test Design**: Write test cases based on acceptance criteria
3. **TDD Implementation**: Red-Green-Refactor cycle
4. **Integration**: Ensure feature works with existing system
5. **Documentation**: Update relevant documentation
6. **Review**: Code review and feedback incorporation

### Local Development Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Set up database
npm run db:migrate

# Start development servers
npm run dev

# Run tests continuously
npm run test:watch
```

### Pre-commit Checks
- ESLint and Prettier formatting
- TypeScript compilation
- Unit test execution
- Commit message validation

## Cost-Conscious Development

### Resource Optimization
- Monitor API usage and implement caching strategies
- Use efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Implement request batching for external APIs
- Set up budget alerts for cloud services

### Performance Monitoring
- Track bundle sizes and loading performance
- Monitor API response times and error rates
- Use React DevTools and browser performance tools
- Implement basic analytics for user behavior

### Deployment Best Practices
- Use environment-specific configurations
- Implement health checks and graceful shutdowns
- Set up proper logging and monitoring
- Use staging environment for testing before production

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document complex business logic and algorithms
- Include JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Maintain up-to-date README files
- Document deployment and setup procedures

### API Documentation
- Use OpenAPI/Swagger for REST API documentation
- Include request/response examples
- Document error codes and handling
- Keep documentation in sync with implementation

This development guide ensures consistent, high-quality code that aligns with the project's cost-conscious and test-driven approach while maintaining professional standards suitable for a production application.
