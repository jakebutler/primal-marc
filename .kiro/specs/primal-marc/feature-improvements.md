    For conducting free web research on current topics, the best APIs include those that provide access to news content, search engine results, and public datasets. Many of these offer a generous free tier for developers and non-commercial use, though they may limit request volume or access to historical data. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
    News and media APIs 
    These APIs are ideal for projects that need current news headlines or articles for tracking topics and media mentions.

    • The Guardian Open Platform: Offers free access to a large archive of The Guardian's content, going back to 1999. It is an excellent resource for deep historical research on a single, high-quality publication. 
    • The New York Times Developer Network: Provides several APIs for accessing NYT content, including the Article Search API, which allows keyword lookups for articles. [1, 3, 6, 7, 8]  

    Search engine results APIs 
    When you need to analyze what's currently being ranked and discussed on major search engines, these APIs provide the structured results. 

    • Serpstack: Offers a free plan with 100 monthly API requests for real-time and accurate Google search results. It handles proxies and CAPTCHAs, and requests can be customized by language, location, and device.

    Public data and content APIs 
    For research that goes beyond news and search results, these APIs tap into a diverse range of public datasets. 

    • Data.gov: The official portal for U.S. government data, offering a free API management service for federal agencies to share data. This provides a single point of entry to hundreds of government datasets. 
    • RapidAPI Marketplace: An API hub with thousands of free or "freemium" APIs covering a vast number of topics. You can browse and search for APIs related to specific areas like weather, sports, and finance. 
    • Common Crawl: This non-profit organization provides a massive archive of raw web crawl data. It's not a standard API but offers free, raw web data for those with more advanced data analysis needs.
